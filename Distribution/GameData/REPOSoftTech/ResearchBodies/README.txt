ResearchBodies adds the ability to research bodies using a new Facility called the Observatory.
You use your funds and your science points to launch a new research plan in a
new zone of the sky, and if you're lucky... You find a new celestial body !
Contracts are offerred to search and research the celestial bodies in the sky.
You can also use the included Infrared Telescope - The Asteroid Day (Stock) telescope and 
the telescopes included in the TarsierSpaceTechnologies mod to find and research celestial bodies.
