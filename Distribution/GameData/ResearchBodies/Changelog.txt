V1.7.2 (01-06-2016) ==
*Changed Contract cancellation (when a contract is generated for a body not yet discovered) to Withdraw instead of Cancel. 
This will not penalise reputation.
*Fixed bug where above code was causing issues when cancelling contracts making the Mission Control building inaccessible.
*Ignore Bodies with Radius < 100m (Sigma/Binaries in Kopernicus)and handles barycenter/orbits of sigma binaries.
*Added support for Blizzy Toolbar (can switch between Stock AppLauncher Icon and Toolbar in the Settings Menu - However, it does not save this setting between game sessions - next version).
*Re-factor and clean-up of the code started.
*If Kopernicus is installed changes the range of the telescope to 540 million kilometers. (standard is 100 million kilometers).
*Added ability to do Tooltips to the GUI windows (Have only added a few for now, more to come).
*Changed the in-flight Telescope - ResearchBodies window to indicate the EC usage each time you press the Search button.
*Added a message to the in-flight window to indicate if there are bodies within the angle of the telescope but are to far away for the telescope to detect them.
*Fixed issues with Kopernicus installed and actually discovering celestial bodies.
*Moved cache data into /ResearchBodies/Plugins/PluginData to avoid resetting Module Manager cache load on startup when these files change.
